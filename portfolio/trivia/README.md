# Trivia Game

## Absolutely Random Trivia

The game begins with the title and a start button. Once clicked, the button disappears and a timer starts counting down from 10 seconds. 

User clicks on one of the possible answer buttons and the game records the answer and moves on to the next question.

Game ends once all ten questions are viewed and displays a summary of correct, incorrect, and unaswered questions. A Start Over button allows user to start the game again without reloading the page.
