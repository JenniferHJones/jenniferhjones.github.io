# Trivia Game

## Interesting Random Trivia

The game begins with the title and a start button. Once clicked, the button disappears and a timer starts counting down from 5 seconds. 

User is supposed to click on one of the possible answer buttons and move on to the next question. (I wasn't able to figure that step out.)

Game ends once all ten questions are viewed and displays a summary of correct, incorrect, and unaswered questions. A Start Over button allows user to start the game again.
