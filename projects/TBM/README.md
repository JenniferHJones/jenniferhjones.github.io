## Description

This application was written for project 3 of the UCD Coding Bootcamp. The front end was built using React, Material-UI, and CSS/CSS Bootstrap. The backend uses Sequelize and Mysql database.

It was designed as a management tool for owners to track their properties. The landing page provides users with the opportunity to learn about the application's features. Once registered/logged in, the user is directed to their dashboard where they have an overview of their rental listings, upcoming expiring leases (feature coming soon), and a calendar.

Users may also do the following via the navbar:

- Add Property button - Add rental properties to their porfolio
- Properties link - View all properties in their portfolio & add them to the Listings page
- Listings Link - View the dates each property was listed for rent and when it became available for occupany as well as property details
