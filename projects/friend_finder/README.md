# Friend Finder

## Overview
This is a full-stack application that uses Node.js and Express server for the back end. The premise is similar to a dating application that takes a user's answers to a ten question survey and compares them to existing users' answers to find the best match (i.e., the lowest absolute difference for all ten questions combined). The app then displays a modal with the best match's name and photo.
